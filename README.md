- Hi!  I'm Owen!  Thanks for checking out my GitHub page!  I am an aspiring IT Associate currently working towards acquiring my first job in the IT world.

- Currently, I'm working towards an Entry Level IT Associate position with future goals of transitioning into Systems Administration.  Additionally, I am dabbling in aspects of data analytics, including (but not limited to) SQL, Tableau/Power BI, and Python.

- I enjoy collaborating with peers and clients alike, and strive to do so in a manner that attains mutual goals and fosters a healthy business relationship.

- Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our dogs and cats, nature walks, travelling, and am an enthusiast of board games, card games, and PC gaming.

  I'm working on a few SQL functions in an application I use in my current job.  I've created a repository here on GitHub detailing some of these functions I've developed.  If you want, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/odubuk/Sundance-MediaPrep-SQL-Filters)!.  I'll be updating the repository with more examples in the future!

- I'm looking to collaborate on anything at the moment!

- You can reach me at ohutchuk@gmail.com.

- Have a great day!
