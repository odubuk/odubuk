- Hi!  I'm Owen!  Thanks for checking out my GitHub page!  I am an aspiring Data Analyst currently working towards acquiring my first job in the IT world.

- My interests include: working with data (obviously!), collaborating/sharing/brainstorming with others, and teaching.

  Outside of the professional world, I enjoy playing board & card games, camera/drone videography, and am a PC enthusiast.

- Currently, I'm working on learning all the elements that go into data analytics, including (but not limited to) SQL, Tableau/Power BI, and Python.

  I'm working on a few SQL functions in an application I use in my current job.  I've created a repository here on GitHub detailing some of these functions I've developed.  If you want, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/odubuk/Sundance-MediaPrep-SQL-Filters)!.  I'll be updating the repository with more examples in the future!

- I'm looking to collaborate on anything at the moment!

- You can reach me at ohutchuk@gmail.com.

- Have a great day!
