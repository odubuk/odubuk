- Hi!  I'm Owen!  Thanks for checking out my GitHub page!  I am an aspiring Data Analyst currently working towards acquiring my first job in the IT world.

- My interests include: working with data (obviously!), collaborting/sharing/brainstorming with others, and teaching.
- Outside of the professional world, I enjoy playing board & card games, camera/drone videography, and am a PC enthusiast.

- Currently, I'm working on learning all the elements that go into data analytics, including (but not limited to) SQL, Tableau/Power BI, and Python.

- I'm looking to collaborate on anything at the moment!

- You can reach me at ohutchuk@gmail.com.

- Have a great day!
